# OpenProject
P2P network with mesh topology which is created and maintained independently.

I am 47 years old and I'm not a programmer. 
There is a desire to organize (initialize) the development of analogue project of the "Netsukuku", or porting of the above-mentioned project to Windows and Android for the comfort of all who want to participate in the development and use of global social networks (resources).
If you have the desire and ability to do something in this direction - respond and join in.

# OpenProject
P2P network with mesh topology which is created and maintained independently.

I am 47 years old and I'm not a programmer. There is a desire to organize the development of analogue project  "Netsukuku", or adapting the mentioned project to Windows version and Android  for all who want to participate in the development and use of global social networks (resources).
